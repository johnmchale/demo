We come from diverse backgrounds and are united by an enthusiasm for great products and delightful customer experiences. Help Scout launched in 2011 and today we have more than 12,000 paying customers in 140+ countries.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Why Help Scout?</span></div>\n<div><strong>We're remote.</strong> It doesn’t matter if you’ve worked remotely before — we’ve been doing it for nearly a decade and are <a class=\"postings-link\" href=\"https://www.helpscout.net/blog/remote-culture/\" rel=\"nofollow\">helping to write the playbook</a> — we’re happy to show you the ropes. Most folks that get a taste of working in a \"remote first\" company have a hard time going back to the old way of doing things.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><strong>We’re passionate about diversity and inclusion.</strong> The data is abundantly clear about diverse teams being more successful, and we're dedicated to setting the team up for success. Today our leadership team is 62% women, and that's just the start. Here's our <a class=\"postings-link\" href=\"https://www.helpscout.com/dei/\" rel=\"nofollow\">DEI Dashboard</a> where you can see all of our team demographic data and read about our commitment to this work.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><strong>We're committed to SMBs for the long term.</strong> Help Scout is focused entirely on serving small and midsize businesses, typically up to 500 employees, because those companies view customer service differently.

The squad is responsible for many of our backend and full-stack services like email, automations, subscriber lifecycles, our developer API, and third-party integrations.</p>\n<p>Some facts about this squad’s domain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1.34 billion emails are sent every month (on average in 2021)</li>\n<li>2.8 billion Sidekiq jobs were processed over the past month</li>\n<li>178 million automation events were processed over the past month</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The role requires a mix of solid distributed systems experience, strong problem-solving skills, and nurturing mentorship abilities.</p>\n<p>ConvertKit Engineering is transitioning from a group of individuals who build the app to a more focused department that can serve our customers at scale. At the same time, we’re still small (about 25 engineers). For an experienced individual contributor who likes to influence engineering culture and wants to work in a low-politics environment where we live our values, this is a great time to join.</p>\n<p>This role is remote - you can live anywhere, but you must work in US or EMEA time zones. To learn more about how our engineering team works, peruse our <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://convertkit.engineering/\" rel=\"nofollow\">engineering blog</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Our Team Culture</strong></p>\n<p>We work to foster close and effective relationships within the team. That means you actively listen to teammates, participate in conversations with candor, and use disagreements to make productive decisions</p>\n<p>We’re accountable for the work we commit to. That means you proactively communicate blockers, hold yourself accountable to timeframes, and balance your work with unblocking others via code reviews, pair sessions, etc.</p>\n<p>We avoid death marches by setting deadlines, limiting scope, and reassessing reality as we go. That means you pay attention to what you’re learning - about our codebase, our systems, and our customers - discuss new insights with teammates regularly, and course-correct as needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>The right person has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expertise in architecting end-to-end features, and - critically - an ability to understand various solutions and communicate clearly about likely benefits, and tradeoffs, and mitigations.</li>\n<li>Experience with high volume background job processing with an eye toward scalability and performance.</li>\n<li>Strong experience writing code that is accessible, scalable, maintainable, and performant</li>\n<li>A keen interest in working closely with Product and Engineering managers on prioritization. That includes analyzing risks and dependencies for proposed features, and providing insight into scope we can cut while still meeting business goals</li>\n<li>A commitment to mentoring and teaching other engineers formally and informally</li>\n<li>Experience with our stack (Ruby/Rails)</li>\n<li>At least 5-7 years building software in a team environment.</li>\n<li>Comfort working remotely in an autonomous and somewhat async environment</li>\n<li>Belief in our mission, vision, and values</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Compensation</strong></p>\n<p>ConvertKit has standardized salaries based on position, no matter where you live. We have six engineering levels. For this role, we’re hiring at a level 4 ($155,000). Level is based upon your experience, our interview process, and our engineering matrix.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Benefits &amp; Perks</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Three weeks (15 days) paid vacation, increasing to four weeks (20 days) paid vacation after one year on the team</li>\n<li>$1,000 yearly vacation bonus for taking five consecutive days of vacation, fully unplugged from work</li>\n<li>10 paid holidays</li>\n<li>Two weeks of sick leave per year, including mental health days</li>\n<li>Up to six weeks paid bereavement leave and medical leave after six months of employment, two weeks of each paid leave in your first six months.</li>\n<li>Twelve weeks of disaster leave for all team members in 2021</li>\n<li>Excellent medical, dental, and vision benefits</li>\n<li>Gender affirming benefits</li>\n<li>Twelve weeks paid parental leave for primary caregivers, ten weeks paid parental leave for secondary caregivers, with flexible scheduling in your child’s first year</li>\n<li>Profit sharing</li>\n<li>$3,200 equipment allowance for your first two years, $2,500 budget every following two years for U.S.-based team members</li>\n<li>401k with a 5% match</li>\n<li>Individual learning &amp; development budget</li>\n<li>Yearly conference credit</li>\n<li>Four-week paid sabbatical after five years with the team</li>\n<li>The team gathers twice a year for fantastic virtual or in-person retreats</li>\n<li>Mandatory Fun Days in 2021, company-wide day-off once a month for every team member</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How To Apply</strong></p>\n<p>We know that most people hate interviewing (we relate!). We aim to make it as good an experience as we can, and part of that includes keeping you informed during the process.</p>\n<p>Here’s what the full set of steps looks like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Written application</li>\n<li>A phone screen with someone on the hiring team</li>\n<li>A short, 2-hour back-end coding and writing assignment</li>\n<li>A technical interview to discuss the homework assignment and your technical knowledge, plus a culture contribution question</li>\n<li>A systems design interview in which we present a business problem and propose a system to deal with the problem, and then we discuss questions and options together. This is followed by a couple of culture contribution questions (on the same call--we're trying to avoid asking you to book a ton of separate interviews with us)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To get started, complete this application, including answers to the questions on the next page. We read every single application, and your responses to our application questions help put your experience into context.</p>\n<p>ConvertKit is an equal opportunity employer. We value diversity in all of its forms, and we hire the best person we can for each role, no matter your personal background. Research tells us that applicants who are female or non-binary, as well as applicants who are people of color, are less likely to apply for roles they do not feel 100% qualified for. If you think you meet more than 50% of our requirements but fewer than 100% of them, please apply. We’re imperfect communicators, so think of our job postings as the starting point for discussion rather than proof that you shouldn’t apply.</p>\n"

We're looking for <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-programmers.md#programmer\" rel=\"nofollow\">Programmer</a> and <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-programmers.md#senior-programmer\" rel=\"nofollow\">Senior Programmer</a> candidates, and we will be accepting applications for the next two weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>About the Job<br></strong>As a programmer on the Mobile team, you'll work on product features in <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://basecamp.com/shapeup/0.3-chapter-01#six-week-cycles\" rel=\"nofollow\">six-week cycles</a> together with a designer, as well as work independently to fix bugs and do technical maintenance in an environment high on autonomy.</p>\n<p>Our iOS apps are written in Swift, our Android apps are written in Kotlin, and both use a <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://medium.com/signal-v-noise/basecamp-3-for-ios-hybrid-architecture-afc071589c25\" rel=\"nofollow\">hybrid web and native approach</a> to reuse web views across platforms, while leveling up important areas of the mobile apps with native code for full fidelity. We recently open sourced the frameworks that underpin our hybrid approach under the <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://hotwire.dev/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hotwire</a> umbrella, and <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/hotwired/turbo\" rel=\"nofollow\">Turbo Native</a> is the foundation of our <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-ios\" rel=\"nofollow\">iOS</a> &amp; <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-android\" rel=\"nofollow\">Android</a> app development.</p>\n<p>The Mobile team at Basecamp functions as one cohesive group, pushing for unified development across platforms. You'll be an integral part of designing new features that work consistently across platforms, but feel natural and appropriate for mobile use. The Mobile team also works to create new JSON APIs to support new native features, further improve Turbo Native and Hotwire, and support new product features that our corollaries on the Basecamp web team build.</p>\n<p>Here are some things the team has worked on recently that might give you a better sense of what you’ll be doing day to day:</p>\n<p>iOS</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.hey.com/new/ios/#ios-composer-upgrades\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rewrote the HEY email composer</a> to be faster, and better handle drafts and offline composition.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.hey.com/new/ios/#ipad-keyboard-navigation\" rel=\"nofollow\">Improved iPad keyboard navigation</a> and keyboard shortcuts.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.hey.com/new/#cover-art\" rel=\"nofollow\">Added a Cover Art feature</a> to cover up your previously seen email in a fun way.</li>\n<li>Open sourced <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-ios\" rel=\"nofollow\">Turbo Native for iOS</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Android</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.hey.com/new/android/#show-device-contacts\" rel=\"nofollow\">Show local device contacts</a> for email autocompleting in the HEY app.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.hey.com/new/android/#video-player\" rel=\"nofollow\">Created an in-app video player</a> for video file attachments.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.hey.com/new/android/#improved-clips\" rel=\"nofollow\">Improved the Clips feature in HEY</a> by layering native components over webviews.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.hey.com/new/android/#search-history\" rel=\"nofollow\">Add a local Search History</a> for the HEY app.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><br>About You<br></strong>We're looking for programmers with strong preferences for and deep experience in the languages we use – Swift or Kotlin. You won't float between operating systems; you'll be fully focused on either iOS or Android development. Yet you'll work closely with your OS counterparts to ensure close unified development of all our mobile apps. You should be intimately familiar with everything it takes to develop top-flight mobile apps, and you should have a significant track record of shipping such apps. Experience with web development in general is desired, and familiarity with Rails is a bonus.</p>\n<p>All of our mobile apps consist of a blend of native and web components. You should be comfortable working in that hybrid environment, but also confident in your abilities to steadily elevate our apps by incorporating more and more native code.</p>\n<p>You’re a <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://basecamp.com/gettingreal/08.6-wordsmiths\" rel=\"nofollow\">good writer</a>. The bulk of our work is written, from the code and <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://signalvnoise.com/archives2/getting_real_copywriting_is_interface_design.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">interfaces we design</a>, to the pull request discussions and long-form proposals we make. Effective, concise writing leads to effective, concise code.</p>\n<p><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1430-hire-managers-of-one\" rel=\"nofollow\">Managers of One</a> thrive at Basecamp. We’re committed generalists, eager learners, conscientious workers, and curators of what’s essential. We’re quick to trust. We see things through. We’re kind to each other, look up to each other, and support each other. We achieve together. We are colleagues, here to do our best work.</p>\n<p>We value people who can take a stand yet commit even when they disagree. We subject ideas to rigorous consideration and challenge each other, but all remember that we’re here for the same purpose: to do good work together. That comes with direct feedback, openness to each others’ experience, and willingness to show up for each other as well as for the technical work at hand. We’re in this for the long term.</p>\n<p>We're not big on credentials, so a Computer Science degree or graduating from a prestigious university is not something we spend much time looking at. We care about what you can do and how you do it, not about how you got here.</p>\n<p>Basecamp is a fully remote company, and this is a remote job. We're hiring from anywhere with at least <strong>4 hours of overlap with the US-Central Time zone</strong> during a normal work day. This could be a 11:00-19:00 schedule from Europe, but we're not hiring from locations that require a graveyard shift to make the overlap happen.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits &amp; Compensation<br></strong>Basecamp pays in the top 10% of the industry based on San Francisco rates. Same position, same pay, no matter where you live. The salary for this position is $165,410 USD for Programmer or $197,819 USD for Senior Programmer. We assess seniority relative to the existing team and in light of the work to be done.</p>\n<p>Our benefits support a life well-lived away from work. Ample time off and all the resources you need to support you in doing the best work of your career. Here's more on the <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://basecamp.com/handbook/07-benefits-and-perks\" rel=\"nofollow\">benefits</a> we offer.</p>\n<p>Applicants from outside of the US will be offered a contractor role on comparable terms and equal pay with our domestic employees.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Apply<br></strong>Please submit an application by <strong>Monday, October 11, 2021, at 5:00PM US-Central time</strong>. Speak directly to the position you're applying for (iOS or Android). Introduce yourself to us as a colleague and share some recent work that you’re especially proud of. Tell us why you want <em>this</em> job and why you’d like to work at Basecamp. We value great writers, so be yourself, be creative, and take your time.</p>\n<p>If you've participated in open source work of any kind, please include links to pull requests, bug reports, feature pitches, or any other public engagement. Open-source participation is by no means a requirement, but if it's something you've done, we'd love to look at it!</p>\n<p><strong>What Happens Next?<br></strong>We expect to take a few weeks to review all applications. You’ll hear from us by October 29 about whether or not we'd like to invite you to an introductory video interview with our head of people operations. You and she will talk through your background and your approach to programming and product development.</p>\n<p>The next phase of the hiring process will be a take-home technical exercise. The exercise is representative of the kind of day-to-day work you'd be doing on the Mobile team. We usually invite fewer than 20 candidates to this stage, and those candidates should expect to spend about 8 hours completing this test (but no more!).</p>\n<p>After the technical exercise, the top candidates will proceed to the final interview stage. You'll talk with 1-2 members of the Mobile team about your technical knowledge and experience, and you'll have a chance to walk through your coding exercise.</p>\n<p>We aim to make an offer by the end of November with a flexible start date in December or January.</p>\n<p>Please note that we’re unable to offer individual feedback during the screening process. We usually see 1,000+ applications for programmer roles, and our hiring team simply doesn’t have the bandwidth to offer personalized feedback before the interview stage.</p>\n<p>This is a demanding application process. We appreciate you giving us that consideration, and we promise to give you our full attention in return. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>\n"

We aim to build the main advertising platform of the Open Web, making it simple for anyone to run effective campaigns online within this $200B market. We believe this is the only way to preserve and improve an open and fair internet.</p>\n<div class=\"h4\">The problem we’re working on</div>\n<p>Advertising on the open web is a mess of unnecessary complexity, opacity, low respect for user privacy and poor performances for advertisers and publishers. This is what allows walled gardens (Google and Facebook) to dominate the online advertising market: as their advertising platforms are simple and efficient. A simple &amp; efficient ad platform for the open web is necessary to promote free access to information outside walled gardens and fight their duopoly.</p>\n<div class=\"h4\">Our solution and achievements</div>\n<p>Since 2017, we’ve been working on the most difficult part of creating the ad platform of the open web. A set of automated tools and technologies to buy advertising in real-time and deliver strong performance for advertisers.</p>\n<p>We’ve proved that our approach works with over <strong>200 brands</strong> running more than <strong>1500 campaigns</strong> as we've consistently beaten every advertising platform on the market in performance. That's why we've quickly grown to an <strong>8 figures in revenue</strong>.</p>\n<p>We are now building and deploying a self-served platform that allows advertisers to launch campaigns in less than 5 minutes on any digital inventory (Web, Apps, connected TV, ...) to deliver results for their brand. This <strong>simple and efficient</strong> platform will soon be available for advertisers across <strong>Europe and North America</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"h4\">Who we are</div>\n<p>KMTX was founded in 2017 by two serial tech entrepreneurs: Franck Tetzlaff (co-founder of Doctolib) and Arthur Querou (co-founder of MotionLead acquired by Adikteev).</p>\n<p><strong>We’ve raised $3m</strong> to date and plan to raise another significant round in the coming months.</p>\n<p>We’re obsessed with <strong>meaningful, powerful tech which simplifies</strong> the work of our users.</p>\n<p>We're not afraid to <strong>challenge the status quo!</strong></p>\n<p>We believe that small increments don't drive change. Anything we do must be<strong> better</strong> than what existed before.</p>\n<div class=\"h4\">Working at KMTX</div>\n<p>We hire people whom we admire.

Do you love the challenge of upgrading a big and critical system? Does reconstructing a database from the binary files without any documentation so you can integrate it with a modern framework sound like a fun challenge? If given a choice, would you choose to hunt and fix bugs over writing new features? Does refactoring, building tests first, and creating easy-to-read, intention-revealing code bring you an immense feeling of satisfaction?</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 34px; vertical-align: baseline;\">If so, you have the attitude we’re looking for!

Think of your favorite HGTV remodeling show, but with code. Our mission is to joyfully remodel software applications to be more stable, scaleable, and secure. We are actively working to create a world where software maintenance is celebrated, codebases are nurtured to provide lasting value, and our clients generate revenue, lower costs, and reduce risk as a result of our work.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 34px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Our founders are recognized thought-leaders in the world of software modernization, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-DZM3I2Fcg\" rel=\"nofollow\">keynoting frequently</a> at software conferences around the world, <a href=\"https://firstround.com/review/forget-technical-debt-heres-how-to-build-technical-wealth/\" rel=\"nofollow\">writing articles</a> in respected periodicals, <a href=\"https://corgibytes.com/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\">blogging</a> about their ideas, and interviewing software leaders on their <a href=\"https://www.legacycode.rocks/\" rel=\"nofollow\">podcast</a>. We encourage you to check out the community we founded over at <a href=\"https://www.legacycode.rocks/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legacy Code Rocks!</a> to connect with other folks who love software maintenance.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 34px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><strong>CULTURE AT CORGIBYTES</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 34px; vertical-align: baseline;\">At Corgibytes, we approach our work through the lens of these core values:</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 34px; vertical-align: baseline;\"> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Act With Empathy</strong><strong>: </strong>Listening and understanding is at the very heart of our culture and we consider empathy a critical technical skill. Consider the people who are impacted by your work: your clients, your users, your teammates, and even your future self.</li>\n<li><strong>Adopt a Growth Mindset:</strong> Solving problems that seem intractable is a big part of what we do. Maintain an attitude of possibility, persevere through challenges, and commit to personal growth.</li>\n<li><strong>Calm the Chaos:</strong> Complex problems require your prefrontal cortex to be engaged. Resist the temptation of an urgency-based culture by focusing on prevention instead of hot-fixes, prioritizing self-care, and developing a steady working rhythm.</li>\n<li><strong>Choose Candor:</strong> Healthy conflict in a psychologically-safe environment is a critical component of a high-functioning team. We hold each other accountable and strengthen our work by challenging ideas respectfully and directly. Speak up and share your point of view, even when it’s hard.</li>\n<li><strong>Communication is Just as Important as Code:</strong> Effective communication is our cultural glue and it is everyone’s job. Produce durable artifacts of your thinking and reject false dichotomies that present code and communication as separate things. No one is “technical” or “non-technical”; everyone is both.</li>\n<li><strong>Craft in Context:</strong> Domain understanding is critical and working in a vacuum leads to problems. Before you leap to conclusions, take the time to understand the problem and match your solution to the situation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 34px; vertical-align: baseline;\">We have a commitment outside of codebases as well. At Corgibytes, we’re really good at transforming broken systems. We modernize code through continuous improvement and marginal gains, and we apply these same practices to systems of social oppression. Similar to how technical debt makes a codebase difficult to work with, there are institutional barriers for some individuals that have accumulated over time. Blindly operating within these structures hurts people and prevents organizations from benefiting from the wide range of perspectives needed to thrive. There’s a lot of opportunity for improvement and we use our core values and our talents as menders to have a positive impact on our society.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 34px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Does this sound like you? Awesome! We live these values every day, and they’re a guide in making decisions, no matter how small. They’ve helped us develop a culture where folks are autonomous, responsible, and work hard without feeling burned out or like they have to choose between family and work. We’re the type of company where it’s common to see a toddler bouncing on a knee during a meeting. As an intentionally distributed team, we focus more on results than micromanagement. Our core values are key to our culture, as are our pillars of autonomy, balance, inclusion, and trust.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 34px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><strong>WHAT YOU WOULD BE DOING:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px;

The team will help with direction and design decisions, trade-off and risk recommendations, and general experience improvements.<br></p><p style=\"margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Your work will be leveraged by Nathan James to move away from 3rd party systems, improve existing workflows, enhance business processes, and reduce costs.</p><br><div class=\"h1\" style='font-size: 2.25rem; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px; font-family: \"ITC Clearface\", serif; font-weight: 400; line-height: 1.3;'>ABOUT US:</div><p style=\"margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">We understand, now more than ever, that time is finite. That’s why with everything we work toward, we try to solve for happiness. Happiness means a lot of different things to different people, so we put in the work that goes into building an inclusive and supportive place for you to do the best work of your career. Our values and our benefits are designed to support a healthy relationship with your work. Our <a href=\"https://nathanjames.com/blogs/latest/nathan-james-operating-values\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"touch-action: manipulation; text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(93, 104, 191); transition: color 150ms ease 0s;\">operating values</a> provide the framework we use in building a happy and resilient organization.<br><br>We also understand working for Nathan James isn’t the main function of your life, and we don’t expect that! We’ve found that a team member who will be happy and fulfilled as a remote team member at Nathan James is someone who values their personal life and identity outside of work. <br><br>That’s why we don’t create mandatory team hangouts or events. We focus on how to improve collaboration, not forcing engagement.<br><br>We collaborate best when we listen and learn from each other. We become stronger when we advocate new perspectives and viewpoints. This gives us all the chance to amplify our voices to achieve our goals. We focus on what we’re solving for, so we don’t create barriers or expectations that distract us from our mission. We also don’t set unreasonable working hours, deadlines, or goals. We create with calm, “slow is smooth and smooth is fast”.  </p><p style=\"margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">When you join the Nathan James team, you can expect a thorough, but mindful onboarding process with ramp-up time to learn. You can expect to give and provide direct feedback. You can expect minimal meetings. You can expect to work with smart and good people. You can expect to be counted on. Most importantly, you can expect to do the best work of your career here. </p><br><div class=\"h1\" style='font-size: 2.25rem; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px; font-family: \"ITC Clearface\", serif; font-weight: 400; line-height: 1.3;'>ABOUT YOU:</div><p style=\"margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">We’re looking for someone who is an open and active communicator with a strong team mentality and is actively curious. You have experience with API-first products, deploying features often and well tested, are passionate about automation, and are comfortable knowing when you need help or don’t know something.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">You love complex challenges, you’re driven by problem solving and not just duct tape solutions. If you don’t know how to do something you use existing documentation and your resourcefulness to dive-deep and figure it out. You don’t require constant hand-holding, but you’re not afraid to speak up when requirements aren’t clear or they require additional context and details.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">You have 6+ years of experience working in a LAMP/LEMP stack with Laravel and REST APIs. Additionally, experience with queues (Redis, RabbitMQ, etc), Vue, and/or DevOps is an added plus. You have at least 3+ years developing and deploying consumer or enterprise applications at scale. At a minimum, you must have deep interest and knowledge of the eCommerce landscape.<br><br>You are proactive in your process and learn quickly, leveraging both software and documentation. You innately work on self improvement.<br><br>You may have a degree or you might not, that’s not what we’re looking for. We care about what you can do and how you do it.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">This is a remote role, since we are a remote company. With the freedom and flexibility of a remote role comes the luxury to work in whichever manner helps you perform your best! However, this ideal is best coupled with an individual who has a keen ability to self regulate and self manage. <br><br>Our team works from home offices, co-working spaces, and coffee shops. You’ll find us in places that foster effective writing, self-discipline, and comfort with open communication.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">If everything you’ve read so far is exciting you on a weird level, then you are the type of person who will thrive at Nathan James! </p><br><div class=\"h1\" style='font-size: 2.25rem; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px; font-family: \"ITC Clearface\", serif; font-weight: 400; line-height: 1.3;'>BENEFITS &amp; PERKS:   </div><p style=\"margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"><a href=\"https://nathanjames.com/blogs/latest/benefits-perks-nathan-james\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"touch-action: manipulation; text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(93, 104, 191); transition: color 150ms ease 0s;\">Our benefits</a> aim to support a life well lived, both at and away from work.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">With these benefits, we want and expect you to take vacations, spend time with your family, be conscious of your wellness, invest in broadening your education, and strengthen your personal happiness.  <br><br></p><div class=\"h1\" style='font-size: 2.25rem; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px; font-family: \"ITC Clearface\", serif; font-weight: 400; line-height: 1.3;'>HOW TO APPLY: </div><p style=\"margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bolder;\">Please submit an application </span><a href=\"https://airtable.com/shrxSJsZ8jrA1jdlW\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"touch-action: manipulation; text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(93, 104, 191); transition: color 150ms ease 0s;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bolder;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: bolder;\"> that speaks directly to this position. </span>There are no right answers or cookie-cutter expectations.

We help our customers — colleges &amp; universities — focus on providing a fantastic education to students by decreasing their administrative costs. We work in a competitive space, ripe for innovation, with users ready to be delighted.</p>\n<p><strong>Our Culture</strong></p>\n<p>As a company, we are guided by our cultural values:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Iterate to evolve</li>\n<li>Cultivate openness</li>\n<li>Act with accountability</li>\n<li>Assume the best</li>\n<li>Practice humility</li>\n<li>Deliver amazing experiences</li>\n<li>Make mistakes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As Kuali engineers, we learn from and teach each other, we practice transparency and empathy, and we delight in delivering value to our customers.</p>\n<p>We work remotely, and have for years. Distributed work is in our bones, with a history of institutions working across state lines on open-source software for more than ten years. Our employees each work in the environment where they’re happiest, from Pennsylvania to Hawaii. We work consciously to create a collaborative and healthy remote work culture, and we travel to meet in person a few times each year.</p>\n<p>Our belief is that diversity and inclusion strengthens us as humans, as teams and as a company. We are committed to building and fostering an environment where all our employees feel included, valued and heard. We strongly encourage applications from women, people of color, people with disabilities, and people with diverse gender and sexual identities and everyone else who is qualified for and excited about the role. </p>\n<p><strong>Everyone should love their work.</strong></p>\n<p>Kuali has been voted a<a class=\"external\" href=\"https://topworkplaces.com/publication/saltlake/kuali/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> top place to work</a> for 4 years in a row by the Salt Lake Tribune. We also made Forbes' list of America's Best Startup Employers for 2020. Not too shabby.</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>Kuali is hiring Software Engineers. As a Software Engineer you will work on one or more of our current products and you will also work on new projects. Kuali builds SaaS web applications for colleges and universities. We help higher-ed institutions manage finances, administer research projects and serve students.</p>\n<p>At Kuali, we believe development, security and operations (DevSecOps) are fundamentally intertwined and best managed by one collaborative, vertical team. Our engineering teams share responsibility for their products and services top to bottom. That means they write code and automated tests, review pull requests, build and manage continuous delivery pipelines to AWS infrastructure and other cloud services to run their code and they monitor how those services are functioning. It also means they take their regular turn at being on-call should anything go wrong. Code is not our product. Our product is well-run services that are useful, delightful, fast, secure and reliable.</p>\n<p>We take pride in our products and their ability to meet the needs of our customers and our company. We believe we ultimately go faster when we take the time to do things right the first time. We don’t rush our work. We invest heavily in automated testing and quality up front. We work to keep tech debt to a minimum.</p>\n<p>We work in a variety of technologies to varying degrees. Java, Node.js, MySQL, MongoDB, Kubernetes, AWS, Elixir and Postgres. Our teams use <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations-ebook/dp/B01M9ASFQ3/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=devops+handbook&amp;qid=1618088892&amp;sr=8-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Continuous Delivery</a> to deliver software. While we may not be enthusiastic about the dogma and ceremony that have become part of many agile approaches, we are still big fans of the original Agile Manifesto, especially the <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">12 principles behind the Agile Manifesto</a>.</p>\n<p>We want our people to work a prioritized, focused 40-hour work week. In our development teams we strive to establish a sustainable pace of delivering high-quality software. We avoid deadlines and anything like death marches. We consider free dinner at work an anti-pattern.</p>\n<p>Expectations</p>\n<p>As a Kuali Software Engineer, we expect the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are an <strong>experienced software engineer well-versed in JAVA</strong> and excited about working in React, Node.js and Elixir.</li>\n<li>Everyone knows that when you take on a task whether it’s huge and scary or tiny and boring, you’re going to see it through to the best of your ability.</li>\n<li>It’s obvious to everyone around you that you have fun with your work and with your co-workers.</li>\n<li>You care about how your work and attitude affects those around you. We mean really care. If you hurt someone, it hurts you. Everything you do runs through this filter.</li>\n<li>You understand that communication is the biggest responsibility of your job as an engineer and the one you’re least likely to get right unless you focus on it.</li>\n<li>You focus on shipping software and running services that matter to your customers, your users and your company.</li>\n<li>You’ve experimented with and survived many different types of development and project methodologies, which has left you with a healthy appreciation for what works from the so-called “agile” methodologies and those that came before (and after) them.</li>\n<li>You know that your team’s time is just as valuable as yours and can tell the difference between valuable meetings and dogmatic ceremony.</li>\n<li>You are humble enough to bend to the will of the frameworks, technologies, constraints, and people you work with when doing so won’t have a materially negative impact. In other words, you can play by someone else’s rules when that’s the easiest and/or best thing to do.</li>\n<li>You make pragmatic (often boring) technology choices at work and you play in your free time (or whenever it’s appropriate). You don’t build science projects just because you are smart enough to build them.</li>\n<li>You don’t feel the need to prove to anyone what a great engineer you are, and therefore...</li>\n<li>You don’t mind being the one that looks bad when you deserve it. You make mistakes sometimes, because you’re human, but rather than dwell on them you choose to fix and then learn from them.</li>\n<li>You love to teach and learn from your co-workers.</li>\n<li>You are versatile with a number of programming languages, operating systems, and architectures. You probably have one of each you prefer right now, but you’re neither dogmatic nor myopic in your focus on it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>We thank </em><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://medium.com/@chadfowler/the-best-job-description-for-an-engineer-ever-written-57b42919cc2f\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Chad Fowler</em></a><em> for this most wonderful list.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remote-first work</li>\n<li>Top-of-the-line equipment of your choice to get your job done</li>\n<li>A truly exceptional benefits package including...\n<ul>\n<li>full premium coverage for employee and dependent medical and dental care</li>\n<li>zero deductible</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>401(k) matching (4%)</li>\n<li>Employee stock option plan</li>\n<li>Paid Maternity/Parental leave</li>\n<li>All the paid time off you need (just work it out with your manager)</li>\n<li>Allowance for continuing education, conferences, and/or training</li>\n<li>Space to work on self-driven projects during quarterly “hack weeks”</li>\n<li>Employee resource groups and community events</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Kuali is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer and does not discriminate in employment matters on the basis of race, color, religion, gender identity or expression, national origin, age, military service eligibility, veteran status, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, or any other protected class.

			"description": "<p><strong><strong>About Sano</strong></strong></p>\n<p>Sano matches those with medical conditions with opportunities to contribute to research, via our unique online platform. We also provide personalised medical insights, information and recommendations. The platform is private-by-design. We feel strongly that people should be in full control of their sensitive health data and choose who can access it.</p>\n<p>Taking part in research is currently hard to do and a poor experience for the patient. Finding out about opportunities is haphazard, and there is often little meaningful return for those who take the time and care to get involved. The result is that organisations with cutting edge theories and medicines to test, can’t find the right patients to work with. To discover cures for the diseases that affect us and our families, we need to enable people to contribute to medical science, effortlessly and on their own terms. We founded Sano to enable medical research that is data-driven and puts patients at the centre of the experience.</p>\n<p>Our current focus is on neurological and immune conditions (Parkinson’s Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Long COVID amongst others).</p>\n<p>A vital part of our offer is free at-home DNA testing. Each patient can then share their genetic data with the studies they wish to contribute to just through a few clicks. In this way, researchers can reach many people who wouldn’t be able to travel, globally, and run their studies much faster and at a lower cost.</p>\n<p>Today, the Sano platform is helping thousands of people connect to relevant research projects including clinical trials which are testing new medicines.</p>\n<p>Over the next year, we are expanding our product to be a 'patient portal' for national scale precision medicine initiatives such as Genomics England, with the goal of impacting millions of people. We are a team of 21 people today, so this is an exceptional chance to join early in our journey to help define our culture, and the company’s mission.</p>\n<p><strong>What you will build</strong></p>\n<p>We need a skilled, reliable, and motivated full-stack engineer who can deliver on tasks involving a mix of frontend and backend related skills. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We’d like to make an open source contribution and make available a free version of our patient research portal that researchers can use in order to start expediting their research and increase the velocity of their research.</li>\n<li>We’d like to continue adding features and functionality to our paid enterprise patient portal product for the likes of Genomics England and other large bioresource partners.</li>\n<li>We want to make it easier for people to join Sano and for Sano users to join research. To do this, we need to build API integrations to securely share data with trusted partners (always with the users permission).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Building robust API integrations with third party services</li>\n<li>Writing server code to return data to the client via REST interfaces</li>\n<li>Making careful adjustments to our database schema to accurately model the entities and relationships that are essential for our product.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Experience in SQL database schema design</li>\n<li>Experience in Python programming</li>\n<li>Experience working with both a Javascript (ideally Vue) frontend and Python backend (ideally Flask).</li>\n<li>Experience in Authentication protocols (OAuth, JWT)</li>\n<li>Experience and good habits with Python unit testing</li>\n<li>Solid fundamentals in best practices of building REST interfaces.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Experience with the following would be a plus:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Experience with Python web frameworks and ORMs e.g. Flask, Peewee, PostgreSQL.</li>\n<li>Experience with client frameworks and datastores such as Vue.js, Vuex, and VuexORM.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Opportunity to define the strategic direction for a quickly growing company</li>\n<li>Company culture driven by transparency, impact, accountability and curiosity</li>\n<li>Flexible/remote working opportunities</li>\n<li>Pension plan</li>\n<li>Employee share options</li>\n<li>25 working days holiday + 8 bank holidays</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note: we are unable to sponsor visas for this position</p>\n<p>Sano Genetics welcomes applications from all candidates irrespective of age, disability, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, religion or belief, or marital or civil partnership status.

			"description": "<p>Please note you would need to be based in Eastern or Central time zone for this position.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Who is Current Health?</strong><br></p> <p>At Current Health, we're building technology and services to identify disease onset and bring treatment straight to the patient. When you join our team, you embark on solving some of the toughest problems our society faces, delivering a platform that directly saves lives.</p> <p>If you want to solve really hard problems, if you want to work in an intense, fast-paced environment where you get to touch and change real-lives on a daily basis, if you are driven to do things better, then we want to know you.</p> <p>The last year has shown that the home can be the best place to receive care. As a result, Current Health has seen massive growth including doubling our team size to almost 80 employees and increasing annual revenue by over 3,000%.  In that same time, we’ve grown our customer base by 5x, now working with some of the largest health systems and pharma companies around the world to deliver healthcare at home.</p>What does an Engineering Manager at Current Health do?<p>Product Engineering teams at Current strive to deliver end-end customer and patient outcomes vs. narrow features. They take care to evaluate where they can further the long term technical vision, whilst having a bias towards action and customer / product value. As an Engineering manager: <br></p><ul> <li>You will be responsible for a product engineering team delivering key objectives that enable the product to scale, directly improving healthcare provision across the world. </li> <li>You will pair with a Product Manager to be accountable for the outcomes delivered by the team. You will have a firm grasp on why the team is building functionality, for whom and the value it will deliver. You will also contribute to that product vision and strategy and likely have strong natural motivation to do so.</li> <li>You will be aware of the impact of your team's work on other areas of the org, including longer term architectural viability of solutions, as well as opportunities for wider cooperation.</li> <li>You will have line management responsibility for the software engineers in your  team, including mentoring, regular 1-1s, performance reviews and guidance for members. </li> <li>You will build, grow and maintain a happy, empowered product team. The Engineering Manager role is central to this aim by employing a mixture of collaborative discovery, design, careful servant leadership and coaching.</li> <li>You will successfully balance your line management with providing technical support and leadership to your cross-functional team, guiding solutions as needed.</li> <li>Using significant prior experience, you will heavily influence the team’s development practises, effective engineering routine and introspection.</li> <li>You will contribute to technical design and code reviews, regularly review team success metrics to enable a high performing Engineering culture and make individual code contributions where appropriate. </li> <li>A successful engineering manager will work closely with other Senior Engineers, EMs and Product managers to form a strong community of leaders within the Engineering organisation.</li> </ul><br> <p>An Engineering Manager with the above experience and skills would bring a lot to our team, but it is not an exhaustive or non-negotiable list.</p><p>We would still very much like to hear from people who identify with Current Health’s purpose and what we are building but who have applicable experience beyond that listed above. <br></p><br>Our tech stack: <p>We recognise that our technology stack is unique to our context. We acknowledge that there will not be perfect overlap between a candidate’s skill set and our technology stack. We value the experience of each member of our team and how that skill set can help shape our technology to deliver better outcomes for all of our patients and customers.</p> <p>Our technology approach is to use the most appropriate technology for the job. We operate with a principle of building core IP, using existing solutions for everything else. We rely heavily on not reinventing technology and particularly on leveraging our AWS backbone and the managed services it can offer.</p><p><br>Our platform is diverse, and ranges from Embedded C on our firmware through Java and Python based microservices as well as Typescript / Angular, iOS and Android platforms for our applications.<br>Our data stores range from Postgres RDS instances, through to DynamoDB KV depending on the domain. Services are decoupled and largely event driven using Kinesis, SQS/SNS where appropriate.   </p> <p>Our teams take care with the reproducibility of our cloud-based environments and lean on Infrastructure as Code technologies such as Terraform to maintain our growing stack.</p> <p>We operate an <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://resources.github.com/whitepapers/introduction-to-innersource/\" rel=\"nofollow\">inner source contribution model</a> for our software</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><p>We want to hear from you if: </p><ul> <li>You have led and managed product-focused, high performance software engineering teams, working together to navigate at times complex and ambiguous problems.</li> <li>You understand that technical contribution can take more forms than just writing code in your role; you can enable and improve the technical direction of the whole team via influence to have a far wider multiplicative impact than code alone. </li> <li>You act as a multiplier, subscribing to the notion of teams being far more powerful than collections of individual engineers.</li> <li>You identify with the philosophy and benefits of “disagree, then commit (to a direction)” as a team works in passionate pursuit of the most appropriate solution to a problem.</li> <li>You strive and push for that feeling you get when a team you lead is thriving; its members happy and growing in confidence and delivering high quality work to production at a regular, predictable and sustainable cadence.</li> <li>You have previously contributed significantly as a Software Engineer and have taken the active decision to focus your career at this point to passionately motivate teams to succeed and deliver more than they thought possible as an individual.</li> <li>From these prior fully hands-on engineering days, you have collected extensive technical experience; knowledge of key patterns, risks, engineering enablement techniques, distributed systems knowledge across managed cloud platforms (AWS), testing approaches and more. You apply this experience daily to drive the team and product forward.   </li> </ul><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><p><br></p><ul> <li>401k contribution up to a maximum of 3% on base salary</li> <li>70% contribution towards Health, Optical and dental plans including partner and family.</li> <li>1 x Life &amp; AD&amp;D Insurance</li> <li>Holidays: 33 days per year inclusive of public holidays</li> <li>Flexible, autonomous working environment</li> <li>Travel expenses covered</li> <li>Spec your own environment</li> <li>Employee Assistance Program</li> <li>Team events</li> <li>Monthly snack box</li> </ul>"

Consumers expect realtime digital experiences as standard and synchronized data in realtime is business critical for many organisations. Yet, at the same time, organizations don’t have the in-house capabilities nor the time to do this efficiently at scale. That’s where Ably comes in.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We provide a suite of APIs to build, extend, and deliver powerful digital experiences in realtime for more than 250 million devices across 80 countries each month.

When we have enough of what we need to act, we act.</li>\n<li><strong>Even the best do better.</strong> We want to be the best - but that doesn’t mean we rest when we are. Improvement and growth - true betterment - is an ongoing journey.

			"description": "<p>Hello there! I’m the VP of engineering at eVisit. We are growing the engineering team, and we’d like you to consider joining us.</p>\n<p>I joined eVisit because I believe in the company’s mission: to simplify healthcare delivery to everyone, everywhere. We are creating technology to make it simpler for you to connect with your doctor, without having to go into the office.</p>\n<p>eVisit’s product is very popular among healthcare professionals. Usage increased by a factor of 10 in just a few months during 2020, and it’s accelerating. As you can imagine, the team needs to grow!</p>\n<p>I came to eVisit to build the best telemedicine platform on the planet. If you join us in 2021, you can put your hand on the steering wheel with us and leave a big mark on this team and the entire healthcare industry. If you’ve ever wished you could look back at a hugely successful company and say “I was part of that”, this is your chance.</p>\n<p><strong>Where’s the job?</strong></p>\n<p>We are 100% remote, and staying that way. We are able to hire people in all 50 states and internationally. You can work from wherever you want. Our team was distributed internationally even before the pandemic. It’s baked into how we work.</p>\n<p><strong>Our technology:</strong></p>\n<p>We don’t require every Solutions Architect to have experience with all our technologies, but we thought you’d like to know where we are today. If you know better technologies, we want to hear about them!</p>\n<p>You will have the opportunity to show or build your skills using a mix of industry standard integration types such as REST APIs and SDKs as well as healthcare specific technologies like HL7 interfaces and FHIR integrations.</p>\n<p>We use Redox to empower our HL7 interfaces and leverage their standard data models in JSON format to allow for our engineers to code against a predictable target.</p>\n<p>We have Epic App Orchard and Cerner Code integrations on our roadmap and you will help to shape the direction of this alongside our integration engineers and product teams.</p>\n<p>While you may not be writing code day to day, it may be helpful to know that we use React for our desktop and mobile web products. On the back-end, we use Ruby on Rails, Go, and NodeJS.</p>\n<p>Our Infrastructure is moving to AWS as we strive for a serverless architecture to minimize the operational burden on engineers.</p>\n<p>For video, we use WebRTC services from Twilio and Vonage.</p>\n<p>And of course, there is much more!</p>\n<p><strong>Our interview process:</strong></p>\n<p>We believe you shouldn’t have to disappear from your current job for an entire day to interview with us. We also believe you shouldn’t have to write code for a live audience, but rather we want you to code on your own time, in your own environment, where you do your best work.</p>\n<p>Here’s how it works:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A 30-minute info call with our recruiter or VP of engineering</li>\n<li>Three 30-minute, back-to-back, one-on-one interviews with our engineers.</li>\n<li>A take-home solutioning exercise</li>\n<li>Group session for you to meet the team</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>We don’t hire solutions architects based on a perfect laundry list of technologies and experiences. We hire based on (1) how well you demonstrate the five eVisit company values, (2) your general solutioning skills, and (3) your ability to learn.</p>\n<p>We believe solutions architects should have the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>System Thinkers</strong>: Solutions architects go beyond band-aid level break fix solutions to problems. The ideal solutions architect is an exemplary individual contributor who can think in terms of architecture, business objectives, and timelines. They focus on solving problems, and aligning with the customer’s requirements.</li>\n<li><strong>Continuous Improvers</strong>: Solutions architects are interested in improving the way eVisit communicates technical concepts with our prospective and current customers as well as improving implementation strategies and optimizing existing integration through analysis, monitoring, analytics, security, and performance improvements.</li>\n<li><strong>Learners</strong>: Solutions architects should have a track record of learning new technologies and diving deep into how things work. They seek balance by not being distracted by every shiny new technology.</li>\n<li><strong>Polyglots</strong>: Solutions architects are proficient in multiple interoperability technologies, including HL7, SSO, API, and SDK related topics. We believe this gives valuable perspective that helps them reach for the best solution for the customer’s problem.</li>\n<li><strong>Collaborators</strong>: Solutions Architects work closely with product managers and designers to create the best integration products for our customers, even in early product definition. They will also field questions from our support team, and triage issues from outside engineering. Additionally, solutions architects will lead the discussions with the customer and their technical staff to align on and achieve the goals of the enterprise integration.</li>\n<li><strong>Experienced</strong>: Time isn’t a guarantee of experience, but we believe that a Solutions architect needs at least 5 years of full-time professional experience to accrue enough good judgment to be considered for the position.</li>\n<li><strong>Healthcare knowledge:</strong> You won’t need to know every possible scenario related to the healthcare integrations but it would help for you to be familiar with the way that large enterprise healthcare organizations conduct work. This includes knowledge of HL7 interfaces, Single Sign On methods, and API interactions. Additionally, it would be helpful to have domain specific knowledge including HIPAA, PHI, and other security controls designed to protect patient data. Don’t let lack of healthcare knowledge deter you from applying.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible</strong>: We expect solutions architects to develop deep expertise in the areas where they work. While we don’t expect any one solution architect to be an expert in every area, we do expect them to be familiar with every area. A solutions architect knows where their knowledge begins and ends, and when to enlist the help of experts and when to level up through education and research.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Competitive salary based on experience</li>\n<li>Great benefits package including medical, dental, vision, HSA &amp; FSA plans</li>\n<li>401(k)</li>\n<li>Generous PTO plan, plus 10 paid national holidays</li>\n<li>A fun, collaborative environment where the company is working to define the future of telemedicine</li>\n<li>Excellent opportunity for professional growth</li>\n<li>100% remote work</li>\n</ul>\n"

Figuring out where to begin your career is a difficult and overwhelming decision. Traditional career services and job boards with millions of postings aren't very helpful. It's also not a fair contest. For many students, opportunity is limited based on where they attend school and their personal networks. RippleMatch is changing this. Our platform is a two-sided marketplace — on one side, we help early-career candidates from around the country discover job opportunities that match their skills and interests without effort. On the other side, RippleMatch helps hundreds of employers like Amazon, eBay, and Teach for America hire top talent virtually and build diverse teams. We have a technical product that leverages automation and intelligent workflows to make finding your dream job or hiring the right candidate easier, faster, and fairer than ever before. Since launching RippleMatch from a college dorm room in 2016, we've raised $34 million in venture funding, grown to 1 million+ users from 1300+ colleges &amp; universities, and brought on hundreds of leading employers as customers.
