We come from diverse backgrounds and are united by an enthusiasm for great products and delightful customer experiences. Help Scout launched in 2011 and today we have more than 12,000 paying customers in 140+ countries.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Why Help Scout?</span></div>\n<div><strong>We're remote.</strong> It doesn’t matter if you’ve worked remotely before — we’ve been doing it for nearly a decade and are <a class=\"postings-link\" href=\"https://www.helpscout.net/blog/remote-culture/\" rel=\"nofollow\">helping to write the playbook</a> — we’re happy to show you the ropes. Most folks that get a taste of working in a \"remote first\" company have a hard time going back to the old way of doing things.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><strong>We’re passionate about diversity and inclusion.</strong> The data is abundantly clear about diverse teams being more successful, and we're dedicated to setting the team up for success. Today our leadership team is 62% women, and that's just the start. Here's our <a class=\"postings-link\" href=\"https://www.helpscout.com/dei/\" rel=\"nofollow\">DEI Dashboard</a> where you can see all of our team demographic data and read about our commitment to this work.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><strong>We're committed to SMBs for the long term.</strong> Help Scout is focused entirely on serving small and midsize businesses, typically up to 500 employees, because those companies view customer service differently.

The squad is responsible for many of our backend and full-stack services like email, automations, subscriber lifecycles, our developer API, and third-party integrations.</p>\n<p>Some facts about this squad’s domain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1.34 billion emails are sent every month (on average in 2021)</li>\n<li>2.8 billion Sidekiq jobs were processed over the past month</li>\n<li>178 million automation events were processed over the past month</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The role requires a mix of solid distributed systems experience, strong problem-solving skills, and nurturing mentorship abilities.</p>\n<p>ConvertKit Engineering is transitioning from a group of individuals who build the app to a more focused department that can serve our customers at scale. At the same time, we’re still small (about 25 engineers). For an experienced individual contributor who likes to influence engineering culture and wants to work in a low-politics environment where we live our values, this is a great time to join.</p>\n<p>This role is remote - you can live anywhere, but you must work in US or EMEA time zones. To learn more about how our engineering team works, peruse our <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://convertkit.engineering/\" rel=\"nofollow\">engineering blog</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Our Team Culture</strong></p>\n<p>We work to foster close and effective relationships within the team. That means you actively listen to teammates, participate in conversations with candor, and use disagreements to make productive decisions</p>\n<p>We’re accountable for the work we commit to. That means you proactively communicate blockers, hold yourself accountable to timeframes, and balance your work with unblocking others via code reviews, pair sessions, etc.</p>\n<p>We avoid death marches by setting deadlines, limiting scope, and reassessing reality as we go. That means you pay attention to what you’re learning - about our codebase, our systems, and our customers - discuss new insights with teammates regularly, and course-correct as needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>The right person has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expertise in architecting end-to-end features, and - critically - an ability to understand various solutions and communicate clearly about likely benefits, and tradeoffs, and mitigations.</li>\n<li>Experience with high volume background job processing with an eye toward scalability and performance.</li>\n<li>Strong experience writing code that is accessible, scalable, maintainable, and performant</li>\n<li>A keen interest in working closely with Product and Engineering managers on prioritization. That includes analyzing risks and dependencies for proposed features, and providing insight into scope we can cut while still meeting business goals</li>\n<li>A commitment to mentoring and teaching other engineers formally and informally</li>\n<li>Experience with our stack (Ruby/Rails)</li>\n<li>At least 5-7 years building software in a team environment.</li>\n<li>Comfort working remotely in an autonomous and somewhat async environment</li>\n<li>Belief in our mission, vision, and values</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Compensation</strong></p>\n<p>ConvertKit has standardized salaries based on position, no matter where you live. We have six engineering levels. For this role, we’re hiring at a level 4 ($155,000). Level is based upon your experience, our interview process, and our engineering matrix.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Benefits &amp; Perks</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Three weeks (15 days) paid vacation, increasing to four weeks (20 days) paid vacation after one year on the team</li>\n<li>$1,000 yearly vacation bonus for taking five consecutive days of vacation, fully unplugged from work</li>\n<li>10 paid holidays</li>\n<li>Two weeks of sick leave per year, including mental health days</li>\n<li>Up to six weeks paid bereavement leave and medical leave after six months of employment, two weeks of each paid leave in your first six months.</li>\n<li>Twelve weeks of disaster leave for all team members in 2021</li>\n<li>Excellent medical, dental, and vision benefits</li>\n<li>Gender affirming benefits</li>\n<li>Twelve weeks paid parental leave for primary caregivers, ten weeks paid parental leave for secondary caregivers, with flexible scheduling in your child’s first year</li>\n<li>Profit sharing</li>\n<li>$3,200 equipment allowance for your first two years, $2,500 budget every following two years for U.S.-based team members</li>\n<li>401k with a 5% match</li>\n<li>Individual learning &amp; development budget</li>\n<li>Yearly conference credit</li>\n<li>Four-week paid sabbatical after five years with the team</li>\n<li>The team gathers twice a year for fantastic virtual or in-person retreats</li>\n<li>Mandatory Fun Days in 2021, company-wide day-off once a month for every team member</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How To Apply</strong></p>\n<p>We know that most people hate interviewing (we relate!). We aim to make it as good an experience as we can, and part of that includes keeping you informed during the process.</p>\n<p>Here’s what the full set of steps looks like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Written application</li>\n<li>A phone screen with someone on the hiring team</li>\n<li>A short, 2-hour back-end coding and writing assignment</li>\n<li>A technical interview to discuss the homework assignment and your technical knowledge, plus a culture contribution question</li>\n<li>A systems design interview in which we present a business problem and propose a system to deal with the problem, and then we discuss questions and options together. This is followed by a couple of culture contribution questions (on the same call--we're trying to avoid asking you to book a ton of separate interviews with us)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To get started, complete this application, including answers to the questions on the next page. We read every single application, and your responses to our application questions help put your experience into context.</p>\n<p>ConvertKit is an equal opportunity employer. We value diversity in all of its forms, and we hire the best person we can for each role, no matter your personal background. Research tells us that applicants who are female or non-binary, as well as applicants who are people of color, are less likely to apply for roles they do not feel 100% qualified for. If you think you meet more than 50% of our requirements but fewer than 100% of them, please apply. We’re imperfect communicators, so think of our job postings as the starting point for discussion rather than proof that you shouldn’t apply.</p>\n"

We're looking for <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-programmers.md#programmer\" rel=\"nofollow\">Programmer</a> and <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/titles-for-programmers.md#senior-programmer\" rel=\"nofollow\">Senior Programmer</a> candidates, and we will be accepting applications for the next two weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>About the Job<br></strong>As a programmer on the Mobile team, you'll work on product features in <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://basecamp.com/shapeup/0.3-chapter-01#six-week-cycles\" rel=\"nofollow\">six-week cycles</a> together with a designer, as well as work independently to fix bugs and do technical maintenance in an environment high on autonomy.</p>\n<p>Our iOS apps are written in Swift, our Android apps are written in Kotlin, and both use a <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://medium.com/signal-v-noise/basecamp-3-for-ios-hybrid-architecture-afc071589c25\" rel=\"nofollow\">hybrid web and native approach</a> to reuse web views across platforms, while leveling up important areas of the mobile apps with native code for full fidelity. We recently open sourced the frameworks that underpin our hybrid approach under the <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://hotwire.dev/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hotwire</a> umbrella, and <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/hotwired/turbo\" rel=\"nofollow\">Turbo Native</a> is the foundation of our <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-ios\" rel=\"nofollow\">iOS</a> &amp; <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-android\" rel=\"nofollow\">Android</a> app development.</p>\n<p>The Mobile team at Basecamp functions as one cohesive group, pushing for unified development across platforms. You'll be an integral part of designing new features that work consistently across platforms, but feel natural and appropriate for mobile use. The Mobile team also works to create new JSON APIs to support new native features, further improve Turbo Native and Hotwire, and support new product features that our corollaries on the Basecamp web team build.</p>\n<p>Here are some things the team has worked on recently that might give you a better sense of what you’ll be doing day to day:</p>\n<p>iOS</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.hey.com/new/ios/#ios-composer-upgrades\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rewrote the HEY email composer</a> to be faster, and better handle drafts and offline composition.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.hey.com/new/ios/#ipad-keyboard-navigation\" rel=\"nofollow\">Improved iPad keyboard navigation</a> and keyboard shortcuts.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.hey.com/new/#cover-art\" rel=\"nofollow\">Added a Cover Art feature</a> to cover up your previously seen email in a fun way.</li>\n<li>Open sourced <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-ios\" rel=\"nofollow\">Turbo Native for iOS</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Android</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.hey.com/new/android/#show-device-contacts\" rel=\"nofollow\">Show local device contacts</a> for email autocompleting in the HEY app.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.hey.com/new/android/#video-player\" rel=\"nofollow\">Created an in-app video player</a> for video file attachments.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.hey.com/new/android/#improved-clips\" rel=\"nofollow\">Improved the Clips feature in HEY</a> by layering native components over webviews.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.hey.com/new/android/#search-history\" rel=\"nofollow\">Add a local Search History</a> for the HEY app.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><br>About You<br></strong>We're looking for programmers with strong preferences for and deep experience in the languages we use – Swift or Kotlin. You won't float between operating systems; you'll be fully focused on either iOS or Android development. Yet you'll work closely with your OS counterparts to ensure close unified development of all our mobile apps. You should be intimately familiar with everything it takes to develop top-flight mobile apps, and you should have a significant track record of shipping such apps. Experience with web development in general is desired, and familiarity with Rails is a bonus.</p>\n<p>All of our mobile apps consist of a blend of native and web components. You should be comfortable working in that hybrid environment, but also confident in your abilities to steadily elevate our apps by incorporating more and more native code.</p>\n<p>You’re a <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://basecamp.com/gettingreal/08.6-wordsmiths\" rel=\"nofollow\">good writer</a>. The bulk of our work is written, from the code and <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://signalvnoise.com/archives2/getting_real_copywriting_is_interface_design.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">interfaces we design</a>, to the pull request discussions and long-form proposals we make. Effective, concise writing leads to effective, concise code.</p>\n<p><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1430-hire-managers-of-one\" rel=\"nofollow\">Managers of One</a> thrive at Basecamp. We’re committed generalists, eager learners, conscientious workers, and curators of what’s essential. We’re quick to trust. We see things through. We’re kind to each other, look up to each other, and support each other. We achieve together. We are colleagues, here to do our best work.</p>\n<p>We value people who can take a stand yet commit even when they disagree. We subject ideas to rigorous consideration and challenge each other, but all remember that we’re here for the same purpose: to do good work together. That comes with direct feedback, openness to each others’ experience, and willingness to show up for each other as well as for the technical work at hand. We’re in this for the long term.</p>\n<p>We're not big on credentials, so a Computer Science degree or graduating from a prestigious university is not something we spend much time looking at. We care about what you can do and how you do it, not about how you got here.</p>\n<p>Basecamp is a fully remote company, and this is a remote job. We're hiring from anywhere with at least <strong>4 hours of overlap with the US-Central Time zone</strong> during a normal work day. This could be a 11:00-19:00 schedule from Europe, but we're not hiring from locations that require a graveyard shift to make the overlap happen.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits &amp; Compensation<br></strong>Basecamp pays in the top 10% of the industry based on San Francisco rates. Same position, same pay, no matter where you live. The salary for this position is $165,410 USD for Programmer or $197,819 USD for Senior Programmer. We assess seniority relative to the existing team and in light of the work to be done.</p>\n<p>Our benefits support a life well-lived away from work. Ample time off and all the resources you need to support you in doing the best work of your career. Here's more on the <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://basecamp.com/handbook/07-benefits-and-perks\" rel=\"nofollow\">benefits</a> we offer.</p>\n<p>Applicants from outside of the US will be offered a contractor role on comparable terms and equal pay with our domestic employees.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Apply<br></strong>Please submit an application by <strong>Monday, October 11, 2021, at 5:00PM US-Central time</strong>. Speak directly to the position you're applying for (iOS or Android). Introduce yourself to us as a colleague and share some recent work that you’re especially proud of. Tell us why you want <em>this</em> job and why you’d like to work at Basecamp. We value great writers, so be yourself, be creative, and take your time.</p>\n<p>If you've participated in open source work of any kind, please include links to pull requests, bug reports, feature pitches, or any other public engagement. Open-source participation is by no means a requirement, but if it's something you've done, we'd love to look at it!</p>\n<p><strong>What Happens Next?<br></strong>We expect to take a few weeks to review all applications. You’ll hear from us by October 29 about whether or not we'd like to invite you to an introductory video interview with our head of people operations. You and she will talk through your background and your approach to programming and product development.</p>\n<p>The next phase of the hiring process will be a take-home technical exercise. The exercise is representative of the kind of day-to-day work you'd be doing on the Mobile team. We usually invite fewer than 20 candidates to this stage, and those candidates should expect to spend about 8 hours completing this test (but no more!).</p>\n<p>After the technical exercise, the top candidates will proceed to the final interview stage. You'll talk with 1-2 members of the Mobile team about your technical knowledge and experience, and you'll have a chance to walk through your coding exercise.</p>\n<p>We aim to make an offer by the end of November with a flexible start date in December or January.</p>\n<p>Please note that we’re unable to offer individual feedback during the screening process. We usually see 1,000+ applications for programmer roles, and our hiring team simply doesn’t have the bandwidth to offer personalized feedback before the interview stage.</p>\n<p>This is a demanding application process. We appreciate you giving us that consideration, and we promise to give you our full attention in return. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>\n"

We aim to build the main advertising platform of the Open Web, making it simple for anyone to run effective campaigns online within this $200B market. We believe this is the only way to preserve and improve an open and fair internet.</p>\n<div class=\"h4\">The problem we’re working on</div>\n<p>Advertising on the open web is a mess of unnecessary complexity, opacity, low respect for user privacy and poor performances for advertisers and publishers. This is what allows walled gardens (Google and Facebook) to dominate the online advertising market: as their advertising platforms are simple and efficient. A simple &amp; efficient ad platform for the open web is necessary to promote free access to information outside walled gardens and fight their duopoly.</p>\n<div class=\"h4\">Our solution and achievements</div>\n<p>Since 2017, we’ve been working on the most difficult part of creating the ad platform of the open web. A set of automated tools and technologies to buy advertising in real-time and deliver strong performance for advertisers.</p>\n<p>We’ve proved that our approach works with over <strong>200 brands</strong> running more than <strong>1500 campaigns</strong> as we've consistently beaten every advertising platform on the market in performance. That's why we've quickly grown to an <strong>8 figures in revenue</strong>.</p>\n<p>We are now building and deploying a self-served platform that allows advertisers to launch campaigns in less than 5 minutes on any digital inventory (Web, Apps, connected TV, ...) to deliver results for their brand. This <strong>simple and efficient</strong> platform will soon be available for advertisers across <strong>Europe and North America</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"h4\">Who we are</div>\n<p>KMTX was founded in 2017 by two serial tech entrepreneurs: Franck Tetzlaff (co-founder of Doctolib) and Arthur Querou (co-founder of MotionLead acquired by Adikteev).</p>\n<p><strong>We’ve raised $3m</strong> to date and plan to raise another significant round in the coming months.</p>\n<p>We’re obsessed with <strong>meaningful, powerful tech which simplifies</strong> the work of our users.</p>\n<p>We're not afraid to <strong>challenge the status quo!</strong></p>\n<p>We believe that small increments don't drive change. Anything we do must be<strong> better</strong> than what existed before.</p>\n<div class=\"h4\">Working at KMTX</div>\n<p>We hire people whom we admire.

Do you love the challenge of upgrading a big and critical system? Does reconstructing a database from the binary files without any documentation so you can integrate it with a modern framework sound like a fun challenge? If given a choice, would you choose to hunt and fix bugs over writing new features? Does refactoring, building tests first, and creating easy-to-read, intention-revealing code bring you an immense feeling of satisfaction?</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 34px; vertical-align: baseline;\">If so, you have the attitude we’re looking for!

Think of your favorite HGTV remodeling show, but with code. Our mission is to joyfully remodel software applications to be more stable, scaleable, and secure. We are actively working to create a world where software maintenance is celebrated, codebases are nurtured to provide lasting value, and our clients generate revenue, lower costs, and reduce risk as a result of our work.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 34px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Our founders are recognized thought-leaders in the world of software modernization, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-DZM3I2Fcg\" rel=\"nofollow\">keynoting frequently</a> at software conferences around the world, <a href=\"https://firstround.com/review/forget-technical-debt-heres-how-to-build-technical-wealth/\" rel=\"nofollow\">writing articles</a> in respected periodicals, <a href=\"https://corgibytes.com/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\">blogging</a> about their ideas, and interviewing software leaders on their <a href=\"https://www.legacycode.rocks/\" rel=\"nofollow\">podcast</a>. We encourage you to check out the community we founded over at <a href=\"https://www.legacycode.rocks/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legacy Code Rocks!</a> to connect with other folks who love software maintenance.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 34px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><strong>CULTURE AT CORGIBYTES</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 34px; vertical-align: baseline;\">At Corgibytes, we approach our work through the lens of these core values:</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 34px; vertical-align: baseline;\"> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Act With Empathy</strong><strong>: </strong>Listening and understanding is at the very heart of our culture and we consider empathy a critical technical skill. Consider the people who are impacted by your work: your clients, your users, your teammates, and even your future self.</li>\n<li><strong>Adopt a Growth Mindset:</strong> Solving problems that seem intractable is a big part of what we do. Maintain an attitude of possibility, persevere through challenges, and commit to personal growth.</li>\n<li><strong>Calm the Chaos:</strong> Complex problems require your prefrontal cortex to be engaged. Resist the temptation of an urgency-based culture by focusing on prevention instead of hot-fixes, prioritizing self-care, and developing a steady working rhythm.</li>\n<li><strong>Choose Candor:</strong> Healthy conflict in a psychologically-safe environment is a critical component of a high-functioning team. We hold each other accountable and strengthen our work by challenging ideas respectfully and directly. Speak up and share your point of view, even when it’s hard.</li>\n<li><strong>Communication is Just as Important as Code:</strong> Effective communication is our cultural glue and it is everyone’s job. Produce durable artifacts of your thinking and reject false dichotomies that present code and communication as separate things. No one is “technical” or “non-technical”; everyone is both.</li>\n<li><strong>Craft in Context:</strong> Domain understanding is critical and working in a vacuum leads to problems. Before you leap to conclusions, take the time to understand the problem and match your solution to the situation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 34px; vertical-align: baseline;\">We have a commitment outside of codebases as well. At Corgibytes, we’re really good at transforming broken systems. We modernize code through continuous improvement and marginal gains, and we apply these same practices to systems of social oppression. Similar to how technical debt makes a codebase difficult to work with, there are institutional barriers for some individuals that have accumulated over time. Blindly operating within these structures hurts people and prevents organizations from benefiting from the wide range of perspectives needed to thrive. There’s a lot of opportunity for improvement and we use our core values and our talents as menders to have a positive impact on our society.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 34px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Does this sound like you? Awesome! We live these values every day, and they’re a guide in making decisions, no matter how small. They’ve helped us develop a culture where folks are autonomous, responsible, and work hard without feeling burned out or like they have to choose between family and work. We’re the type of company where it’s common to see a toddler bouncing on a knee during a meeting. As an intentionally distributed team, we focus more on results than micromanagement. Our core values are key to our culture, as are our pillars of autonomy, balance, inclusion, and trust.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 34px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><strong>WHAT YOU WOULD BE DOING:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px;

The team will help with direction and design decisions, trade-off and risk recommendations, and general experience improvements.<br></p><p style=\"margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Your work will be leveraged by Nathan James to move away from 3rd party systems, improve existing workflows, enhance business processes, and reduce costs.</p><br><div class=\"h1\" style='font-size: 2.25rem; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px; font-family: \"ITC Clearface\", serif; font-weight: 400; line-height: 1.3;'>ABOUT US:</div><p style=\"margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">We understand, now more than ever, that time is finite. That’s why with everything we work toward, we try to solve for happiness. Happiness means a lot of different things to different people, so we put in the work that goes into building an inclusive and supportive place for you to do the best work of your career. Our values and our benefits are designed to support a healthy relationship with your work. Our <a href=\"https://nathanjames.com/blogs/latest/nathan-james-operating-values\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"touch-action: manipulation; text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(93, 104, 191); transition: color 150ms ease 0s;\">operating values</a> provide the framework we use in building a happy and resilient organization.<br><br>We also understand working for Nathan James isn’t the main function of your life, and we don’t expect that! We’ve found that a team member who will be happy and fulfilled as a remote team member at Nathan James is someone who values their personal life and identity outside of work. <br><br>That’s why we don’t create mandatory team hangouts or events. We focus on how to improve collaboration, not forcing engagement.<br><br>We collaborate best when we listen and learn from each other. We become stronger when we advocate new perspectives and viewpoints. This gives us all the chance to amplify our voices to achieve our goals. We focus on what we’re solving for, so we don’t create barriers or expectations that distract us from our mission. We also don’t set unreasonable working hours, deadlines, or goals. We create with calm, “slow is smooth and smooth is fast”.  </p><p style=\"margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">When you join the Nathan James team, you can expect a thorough, but mindful onboarding process with ramp-up time to learn. You can expect to give and provide direct feedback. You can expect minimal meetings. You can expect to work with smart and good people. You can expect to be counted on. Most importantly, you can expect to do the best work of your career here. </p><br><div class=\"h1\" style='font-size: 2.25rem; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px; font-family: \"ITC Clearface\", serif; font-weight: 400; line-height: 1.3;'>ABOUT YOU:</div><p style=\"margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">We’re looking for someone who is an open and active communicator with a strong team mentality and is actively curious. You have experience with API-first products, deploying features often and well tested, are passionate about automation, and are comfortable knowing when you need help or don’t know something.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">You love complex challenges, you’re driven by problem solving and not just duct tape solutions. If you don’t know how to do something you use existing documentation and your resourcefulness to dive-deep and figure it out. You don’t require constant hand-holding, but you’re not afraid to speak up when requirements aren’t clear or they require additional context and details.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">You have 6+ years of experience working in a LAMP/LEMP stack with Laravel and REST APIs. Additionally, experience with queues (Redis, RabbitMQ, etc), Vue, and/or DevOps is an added plus. You have at least 3+ years developing and deploying consumer or enterprise applications at scale. At a minimum, you must have deep interest and knowledge of the eCommerce landscape.<br><br>You are proactive in your process and learn quickly, leveraging both software and documentation. You innately work on self improvement.<br><br>You may have a degree or you might not, that’s not what we’re looking for. We care about what you can do and how you do it.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">This is a remote role, since we are a remote company. With the freedom and flexibility of a remote role comes the luxury to work in whichever manner helps you perform your best! However, this ideal is best coupled with an individual who has a keen ability to self regulate and self manage. <br><br>Our team works from home offices, co-working spaces, and coffee shops. You’ll find us in places that foster effective writing, self-discipline, and comfort with open communication.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">If everything you’ve read so far is exciting you on a weird level, then you are the type of person who will thrive at Nathan James! </p><br><div class=\"h1\" style='font-size: 2.25rem; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px; font-family: \"ITC Clearface\", serif; font-weight: 400; line-height: 1.3;'>BENEFITS &amp; PERKS:   </div><p style=\"margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"><a href=\"https://nathanjames.com/blogs/latest/benefits-perks-nathan-james\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"touch-action: manipulation; text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(93, 104, 191); transition: color 150ms ease 0s;\">Our benefits</a> aim to support a life well lived, both at and away from work.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">With these benefits, we want and expect you to take vacations, spend time with your family, be conscious of your wellness, invest in broadening your education, and strengthen your personal happiness.  <br><br></p><div class=\"h1\" style='font-size: 2.25rem; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px; font-family: \"ITC Clearface\", serif; font-weight: 400; line-height: 1.3;'>HOW TO APPLY: </div><p style=\"margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bolder;\">Please submit an application </span><a href=\"https://airtable.com/shrxSJsZ8jrA1jdlW\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"touch-action: manipulation; text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(93, 104, 191); transition: color 150ms ease 0s;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bolder;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: bolder;\"> that speaks directly to this position. </span>There are no right answers or cookie-cutter expectations.
