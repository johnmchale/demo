We come from diverse backgrounds and are united by an enthusiasm for great products and delightful customer experiences. Help Scout launched in 2011 and today we have more than 12,000 paying customers in 140+ countries.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Why Help Scout?</span></div>\n<div><strong>We're remote.</strong> It doesn’t matter if you’ve worked remotely before — we’ve been doing it for nearly a decade and are <a class=\"postings-link\" href=\"https://www.helpscout.net/blog/remote-culture/\" rel=\"nofollow\">helping to write the playbook</a> — we’re happy to show you the ropes. Most folks that get a taste of working in a \"remote first\" company have a hard time going back to the old way of doing things.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><strong>We’re passionate about diversity and inclusion.</strong> The data is abundantly clear about diverse teams being more successful, and we're dedicated to setting the team up for success. Today our leadership team is 62% women, and that's just the start. Here's our <a class=\"postings-link\" href=\"https://www.helpscout.com/dei/\" rel=\"nofollow\">DEI Dashboard</a> where you can see all of our team demographic data and read about our commitment to this work.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><strong>We're committed to SMBs for the long term.</strong> Help Scout is focused entirely on serving small and midsize businesses, typically up to 500 employees, because those companies view customer service differently. It's not a cost to be optimized, it's their most effective marketing tool and a key differentiator from the competition. We built Help Scout for companies that truly <em>value</em> being customer-centric (like us) and want a product that shares their values.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><strong>We're leaving the world better than we found it.</strong> Did you know Help Scout is a certified B Corporation, with a mission to give away at least 1% of our product through <a class=\"postings-link\" href=\"https://www.helpscout.com/for-good/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Help Scout for Good</a>?
